Title: EncodeDNA
Author: Kyle Frohlich

EncodeDNA is an auxiliary program meant to supplement and test the functionality of
DNencrypt. This program does nothing but convert ascii into DNA using the cryptographical
key of 00 = A, 01 = T, 10 = C, and 11 = G.

Steps
1.) In terminal run the "make" command to compile and generate the executable,
2.) Your code that you want to translate should be entered into "input.txt".
3.) Run "./encode".
4.) Your code in "input.txt" will be translated into DNA in "output.txt".
